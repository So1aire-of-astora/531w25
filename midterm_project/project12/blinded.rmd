# Introduction

Financial markets are inherently dynamic, characterized by fluctuations
in asset prices driven by economic conditions, investor sentiment, and
external events. Volatility, which measures the degree of variation in
asset prices over time is measured by the standard deviation of returns.
It is a critical metric for investors, traders, and policymakers.
Accurately forecasting volatility helps in portfolio risk management,
option pricing, and algorithmic trading. While numerous statistical and
machine learning approaches exist for predicting stock prices,
forecasting volatility presents unique challenges. Unlike stock prices,
volatility exhibits clustering effects, where periods of high volatility
tend to be followed by more high volatility and vice versa.
Additionally, volatility often demonstrates long-range dependence and
seasonality, making simple linear models inadequate for capturing its
behavior. In this study, we aim to forecast the volatility of the S&P
500 using a combination of statistical and time series modeling
techniques, including ARIMA, SARIMA, and GARCH models.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tseries)
library(zoo)
library(stats)
library(forecast)
library(knitr)
library(rugarch)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("features_target.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
colnames(data)[1] <- "Date"
# Convert the Date column to Date format
data$Date <- as.Date(data$Date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
thirty_day_data <- data$SP500.30.Day.Volatility
```

# Data Exploration

The dataset contains daily S&P 500 returns from 2010 to 2020, with data
for 252 trading days a year. Let's begin by plotting the time-series for
the S&P 500 prices.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data.frame(Date = data$Date, Volatility = thirty_day_data), aes(x = Date, y = Volatility)) +
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  ggtitle("Realized 30- Day Volatility") +
  xlab("Date") + ylab("Volatility") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The time-series plot of realized 30-day volatility in the S&P 500 index
shows instances of high volatility in certain periods, particularly
around 2011, 2015-2016, and 2018-2019. Next we plot the histogram to
understand its distribution.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x = SP500.30.Day.Volatility)) +
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="blue", bins = 30, alpha=0.7) +
  ggtitle("Histogram of 30-Day Volatility") +
  xlab("Volatility") + ylab("Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The histogram of 30-day volatility is right-skewed, indicating that
lower volatility levels are more frequent, while extreme volatility
spikes occur less often.

## Stationarity and Autocorrelation

To ensure the suitability of our time series for modeling, we performed
the KPSS (Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin) test to assess
stationarity. We use the KPSS test instead of the ADF (Augmented
Dickey-Fuller) test because KPSS directly tests for stationarity,
whereas ADF tests for non-stationarity. The ADF test has low power in
detecting stationarity, especially in trend-stationary processes or with
structural breaks. A p-value of 0.01 in the initial test suggests strong
evidence against stationarity, indicating the presence of a unit root
and the necessity of transformation.

To address this, we applied first-order differencing and re-evaluated
stationarity using the KPSS test. The resulting p-value of 0.1 indicates
that the differenced series is now stationary at the 5% significance
level.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kpss_test <- kpss.test(na.omit(data$SP500.30.Day.Volatility))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))  
acf(thirty_day_data, main="ACF of 30-Day Volatility")  # Autocorrelation function
pacf(thirty_day_data, main="PACF of 30-Day Volatility")  # Partial autocorrelation function
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
diff_volatility <- diff(data$SP500.30.Day.Volatility)
kpss_test <- kpss.test(diff_volatility, null = "Level")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
acf(diff_volatility, main = "ACF of Differenced 30-Day Volatility")
pacf(diff_volatility, main = "PACF of Differenced 30-Day Volatility")
```

Looking at the ACF and PACF plots, we observe that before differencing,
the ACF plot shows a slow decay, reinforcing the presence of a unit root
and confirming that the series is non-stationary. The PACF plot exhibits
a strong lag-1 autocorrelation, suggesting potential autoregressive
behavior. After differencing, the ACF of the differenced series now
decays more rapidly, indicating improved stationarity. The PACF of the
differenced series shows a significant spike at lag 1, suggesting a
possible AR(1) process.

# Spectral Analysis

To analyze the underlying patterns in S&P 500 30-day realized
volatility, we apply spectral analysis, which helps identify dominant
periodic cycles and long-term trends. We begin with STL decomposition,
which separates the series into trend, seasonal, and remainder
components. Assuming a 30-day cycle, the decomposition reveals a clear
seasonal pattern, a smooth trend reflecting long-term volatility
movements, and a remainder component capturing short-term fluctuations.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
volatility <- ts(data$SP500.30.Day.Volatility, frequency = 252) # Assuming 252 trading days per year
decomposed_volatility <- stl(volatility, s.window = "periodic")
plot(decomposed_volatility, main = "STL Decomposition of 30-Day Realized Volatility")

```

To further investigate cyclical behavior, we compute periodograms for
both the original volatility series and its STL components. Unlike STL
decomposition, which operates in the time domain, spectral analysis
helps identify dominant frequencies in the data. For the STL
decomposition, we set the frequency to 30 to capture short-term, monthly
volatility cycles. However, for spectral analysis, we use a frequency of
252 to detect broader periodicity over a full trading year. This
distinction allows us to analyze both short-term seasonality and
longer-term cyclical behavior. The analysis reveals a clear seasonal
component, suggesting periodic fluctuations in volatility, a smooth
trend component which reflects long-term variations in market
conditions, and a remainder component capturing residual noise.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
volatility_ts <- ts(data$SP500.30.Day.Volatility, frequency = 30)  # Assuming monthly frequency

# STL Decomposition
stl_decomp <- stl(volatility_ts, s.window = "periodic")

# Extract components
trend_component <- stl_decomp$time.series[, "trend"]
seasonal_component <- stl_decomp$time.series[, "seasonal"]
remainder_component <- stl_decomp$time.series[, "remainder"]

spec <- spectrum(volatility_ts, spans = c(3, 3), main = "Periodogram of 30-Day Volatility")
spec2 <- spectrum(remainder_component, spans = c(3, 3), main = "Periodogram of Remainder Component")
spec3 <- spectrum(seasonal_component, spans = c(3, 3), main = "Periodogram of the Seasonal Component")

max_freq <- spec$freq[which.max(spec$spec)]
```

Hence, the periodogram of the volatility series reveals prominent peaks,
confirming periodic variations. The seasonal componentâ€™s periodogram
further supports the presence of recurrent cycles in market volatility.
We can also see that the trend component has an upward trend indicating
a long-term increase in volatility over the years, with local peaks
which coincide with the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Model Selection and Residual Diagnostics:

## ARIMA Model

### Model Selection

Based on our data analysis in the previous sections, according to the
KPSS test, we find that the original data is not stationary but it
becomes stationary after we take a first order difference, therefore we
decide to fit an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Avergage Model with
$d = 1$, namely $ARIMA(p,1,q)$. Generally, Autoregressive Integrated
Moving Avergae Model $ARIMA(p,d,q)$ with intercept $\mu$ for $Y_{1:N}$
can be expressed mathematically as follows (Chapter 4: Linear time
series models and the algrebra of ARMA models) :

$$
\phi(B)[(1-B)^dY_n-\mu] = \varphi(B)\epsilon_n 
$$

where

$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi(x) &= 1-\phi_1x-\phi_2x^2...-\phi_px^p \\
\psi(x) &= 1+\psi_1x+\psi_2x^2+...+\psi_qx^q \\
\{\epsilon_n\} & \sim WN(\sigma^2) \quad \text{White Noise Process}
\end{aligned}
$$

Or equivalently, if we denote $Z_n = \Delta Y_n = Y_n-Y_{n-1}$, it
becomes an $ARMA(p, q)$ with intercept $\mu$ for $Z_{1:N}$

$$
\phi(B)[Z_n-\mu] = \varphi(B)\epsilon_n \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 
Z_n = \mu +\phi_1Z_{n-1}+...+\phi_pZ_{n-p}+\varphi_1\epsilon_{n-1}+...+\varphi_q\epsilon_{n-q}+\epsilon_n
$$

In order to determine the best model, we use grid search for different
$(p, q)$ pairs with $p, q \in\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ based on Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) values$^{5}$, (Chapter 5: Parameter
estimation and model identification for ARMA models). We make an AIC
comparison table and choose the model with the lowest AIC value as our
best model.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

set.seed(123)
aic_table = function(data, P, Q){
  table = matrix(NA, (P+1), (Q+1))
  best_model = NULL
  second_best_model = NULL
  best_aic = Inf
  for (p in 0:P){
    for (q in 0:Q){
      model = arima2::arima(data, order = c(p, 1, q))
      aic_value = model$aic
      table[p+1, q+1] = aic_value
      if (aic_value < best_aic) {
        best_aic = aic_value
        second_best_model = best_model
        best_model = model
      }
    }
  }
  dimnames(table) = list(paste("AR", 0:P, sep = ""), paste("MA", 0:Q, sep = ""))
  require(knitr)
  print(kable(table, digits = 2))
  return(list(best_model, second_best_model))
}

result = aic_table(data$SP500.30.Day.Volatility, 5, 5)
best_model = result[[1]]
second_best_model = result[[2]]
summary(best_model)
summary(second_best_model)
```

Based on the AIC comparison table, the $ARIMA(4, 1, 3)$ and
$ARIMA(4, 1, 4)$ can be the potential candidates of our best model as
their AIC values are almost the same, which means they fit our data
almost equally well. However, after extracting the summary of these two
models, we notice that in the $ARIMA(4, 1, 4)$ model, the MA(4)
coefficient is 0.0474, which is significantly smaller than other AR and
MA coefficients and indicates potential overfitting issue. Therefore, we
further conduct a likelihood ratio test to determine if it is necessary
to include an extra ma4 term based on $ARIMA(4, 1, 3)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
H_0: \quad ARIMA(4, 1, 3) \\
H_1: \quad ARIMA(4, 1, 4) 
\end{aligned}
$$

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(lmtest)
lrtest(second_best_model, best_model)
best_model = second_best_model
```

The p-value of the likelihood ratio test is 0.1394 \> 0.05. Therefore,
we fail to reject our null hypothesis, we claim $ARIMA(4, 1, 3)$ as our
best model and further specify its model structure.

$$
\phi(B)[(1-B)Y_n] = \psi(B)\epsilon_n 
$$

where $$
\begin{aligned}
\phi(x) &= 1-\phi_1x-\phi_2x^2-\phi_3x^3-\phi_4x^4 \\
\psi(x) &= 1+\psi_1x+\psi_2x^2+\psi_3x^3\\
\{\epsilon_n\} & \sim WN(\sigma^2) \quad \text{White Noise Process}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Model Diagnosis

#### Causality and Invertibility

We want to check the causality and invertibility$^{5}$, (Chapter 6:
Extending the ARMA model: Seasonality, integration and trend) of our
$ARIMA(4, 1, 3)$ model, and visualize the roots on the complex plane.

```{r echo=FALSE}
ar_roots = arima2::ARMApolyroots(best_model, type = "AR")
ma_roots = arima2::ARMApolyroots(best_model, type = "MA")

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(Re(ar_roots), Im(ar_roots), xlim = c(-1.5, 1.5), ylim = c(-1.5, 1.5), 
     xlab = "Real", ylab = "Imaginary", 
     main = "Roots of AR Polynomial", 
     pch = 19, col = "red")
theta = seq(0, 2*pi, length.out = 100)
lines(cos(theta), sin(theta), col = "blue", lwd = 2) 
abline(h = 0, v = 0, lty = 2, col = "gray")

plot(Re(ma_roots), Im(ma_roots), xlim = c(-1.5, 1.5), ylim = c(-1.5, 1.5), 
     xlab = "Real", ylab = "Imaginary", 
     main = "Roots of MA Polynomial", 
     pch = 19, col = "red")
theta = seq(0, 2*pi, length.out = 100)
lines(cos(theta), sin(theta), col = "blue", lwd = 2) 
abline(h = 0, v = 0, lty = 2, col = "gray")

cat("If the AR polynomial roots outside the unit circle:", abs(ar_roots) > 1, "\n")
cat("If the MA polynomial roots outside the unit circle:", abs(ma_roots) > 1, "\n")
```

We can infer that our $ARIMA(4, 1, 3)$ model AR polynomial and MA
polynomial don't have any equivalent root that indicates parameter
redundancy, and all roots are outside the unit circle, therefore
indicates causality and invertibility of our $ARIMA(4, 1, 3)$ model.

#### Residual Analysis

We perform residual diagnosis by using *checkresiduals()* function in
the forecast package and making a additional QQ-plot to further check
the normality assumption. The *checkresiduals()* call will give four
outcomes, one hypothesis test the Ljung-Box test, and three plots
including a time plot of the residuals, the corresponding ACF, and a
histogram with an added standard normal density curve.

The Ljung-Box test, which is designed as follows: $$
\begin{aligned}
H_0 : &\quad \text{The data is not correlated} \\
H_1 : &\quad \text{The data exhibit serial correlation} \\
\end{aligned} \\
\text{Test Statistics:} \quad Q=n(n+2) \sum_{k=1}^h \frac{\hat{\rho}_k^2}{n-k}
$$

where $n$ is the sample size, $\hat{\rho}_k$ is the sample
autocorrelation at lag $k$, and $h$ is the number of lags being tested.
Under $H_0$ the statistic $Q$ asymptotically follows a $\chi_{(h)}^2$.
For significance level $\alpha$, the critical region for rejection of
the hypothesis of randomness is:

$$
Q>\chi_{1-\alpha, h}^2 
$$

where $\chi_{1-\alpha, h}^2$ is the $(1-\alpha)$-quantile of the
chi-squared distribution with $h$ degrees of freedom.

```{r echo=FALSE}
checkresiduals(best_model, lag = 20)
res = residuals(best_model)
qqnorm(res, main = "Normal QQ Plot")
qqline(res, lwd = 2, col = "red")
```

Therefore, we can make the following claims on residuals of our
$ARIMA(4, 1, 3)$ model:

1.  The residuals are correlated.

    As the Ljung-Box test gives a p-value of 0.003762 \< 0.05, which
    means we reject our null hypothesis that the residuals are not
    correlated; and the residuals ACF plot also indicates that there are
    significant autocorrelations in residuals at lag 14, 20, 28.

2.  The residuals approximately have mean 0, but the variance seems
    unstable.

    From the time plot of the residuals, the residuals approximately
    oscillate around 0, but the variance seems unstable as several sharp
    peaks appear before the residual of the 2000th data point and
    general larger variations after the residual of the 2000th data
    point.

3.  The residuals are not normally distributed.

    As the histogram shows that the residuals have significantly larger
    density near 0 compared with the standard normal distribution, and
    the QQ plot indicates the residuals have heavy tails in both
    negative and positive directions.

Therefore, this $ARIMA(3, 1, 4)$ model fails to capture the time series
characteristics of our data, we wonder if we can improve the model
fitting by including seasonality into consideration.

## SARIMA Model

### Model Selection

As literature in finance analysis and our frequency analysis above
indicate a possible 30 days cycle period in our daily data set, we
consider including seasonality with period 30 based on our previous
$ARIMA(4, 1, 3)$ model, and check if adding seasonality leads to a
better fit. Therefore, we further define our
$SARIMA(4, 1, 3)\times(P, D, Q)_{30}$ as follows$^5$ (Chapter 5 :
Parameter estimation and model identification for ARMA models):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi(B) &\Phi\left(B^{30}\right)\left[(1-B)\left(1-B^{12}\right)^D Y_n-\mu\right]=\psi(B) \Psi\left(B^{30}\right) \epsilon_n \\
&\phi(B) = 1-\phi_1B-\phi_2B^2-\phi_3B^3-\phi_4B^4 \\
&\psi(B) = 1+\psi_1B+\psi_2B^2+\psi_3B^3\\
&\Phi(B^{30}) = 1-\Phi_1B^{30}-...-\Phi_PB^{30} \\
&\Psi(B^{30}) = 1+\Psi_1B^{30}+...+\Psi_QB^{30} \\
&\{\epsilon_n\} \sim WN(\sigma^2)  \quad \text{White Noise Process}
\end{aligned}
$$

After we try to fit $SARIMA(4, 1, 3)\times(P, D, Q)_{30}$, we find that
$P, D, Q$ take values larger than 2 will significantly increase model
complexity and cause errors, therefore, we try to search the best model
among $SARIMA(4, 1, 3)\times(1, 0, 0)_{30}$,
$SARIMA(4, 1, 3)\times(0, 0, 1)_{30}$,
$SARIMA(4, 1, 3)\times(1, 1, 0)_{30}$,
$SARIMA(4, 1, 3)\times(0, 1, 1)_{30}$, and
$SARIMA(4, 1, 3)\times(1, 1, 1)_{30}$ models.

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
model1 = Arima(data$SP500.30.Day.Volatility, order = c(4, 1, 3), seasonal = list(order = c(1, 0, 0), period = 30))
model2 = Arima(data$SP500.30.Day.Volatility, order = c(4, 1, 3), seasonal = list(order = c(0, 0, 1), period = 30))
model3 = Arima(data$SP500.30.Day.Volatility, order = c(4, 1, 3), seasonal = list(order = c(1, 1, 0), period = 30))
model4 = Arima(data$SP500.30.Day.Volatility, order = c(4, 1, 3), seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 1), period = 30))
model5 = Arima(data$SP500.30.Day.Volatility, order = c(4, 1, 3), seasonal = list(order = c(1, 1, 1), period = 30))

aic_list = c(model1$aic, model2$aic, model3$aic, model4$aic, model5$aic)
cat("The the", which.min(aic_list), "th model has the lowest AIC value.")
```

We can see that the model5 $SARIMA(4, 1, 3)\times(1, 1, 1)_{30}$ has the
lowest AIC value, but it is larger than the AIC value given by our
previous $ARIMA(4, 1, 3)$ model. We extract the summary and specify our
model structure as follows:

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(model5)
```

$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi(B) &\Phi\left(B^{30}\right)\left[(1-B)\left(1-B^{12}\right) Y_n-\mu\right]=\psi(B) \Psi\left(B^{30}\right) \epsilon_n \\
&\phi(x) = 1-\phi_1x-\phi_2x^2-\phi_3x^3-\phi_4x^4 \\
&\psi(x) = 1+\psi_1x+\psi_2x^2+\psi_3x^3\\
&\Phi(x^{30}) = 1-\Phi_1x^{30} \\
&\Psi(x^{30}) = 1+\Psi_1x^{30} \\
&\{\epsilon_n\} \sim WN(\sigma^2)  \quad \text{White Noise Process}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Residual Analysis

```{r echo=FALSE}
checkresiduals(model5, lag = 20)
res = residuals(model5)
qqnorm(res, main = "Normal QQ Plot")
qqline(res, lwd = 2, col = "red")
```

After fitting the $SARIMA(4, 1, 3)\times(1, 1, 1)_{30}$ model, similar
conclusions of residuals can be drawn, therefore
$SARIMA(4, 1, 3)\times(1, 1, 1)_{30}$ fitting is still not satisfying,
which further indicate that the seasonality in our data is not very
strong and cannot improve our model fitting. Therefore, we should
consider a more complex model, an ARMA+GARCH model with varying variance
and non-normal errors (actually we tried student t errors, but we failed
in model explanation and diagnosis, therefore we still stick to normal
errors in the ARMA+GARCH model).

## ARMA+GARCH Model

### Mathematical Background and Model Derivation

Financial time series often exhibit *volatility clustering*: periods
during which high volatility tends to be followed by high volatility and
low volatility by low volatility. Traditional ARMA models focus on
capturing the linear dynamics of the conditional mean but assume a
constant variance. However, empirical evidence shows that the variance
(or volatility) of financial returns is time-varying. This observation
motivates the use of the **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional
Heteroscedasticity)** model, which explicitly models the evolving
conditional variance.

#### Model Formulation

We begin by decomposing the observed return series $r_t$ as follows$^8$:

$$
r_t = \sigma_t z_t,\quad z_t \sim N(0,1),
$$

where:

-   $z_t$ is a standard normal random variable,

-   $\sigma_t$ is the conditional standard deviation (i.e., the
    volatility) at time $t$.

This formulation separates the scale (e.g. volatility) from the
standardized noise, allowing us to model the time-varying behavior of
volatility independently.

In contrast, a traditional ARMA model typically expresses the
conditional mean as: $$
r_t = \mu + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \phi_i\, r_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^{q} \theta_j\, \varepsilon_{t-j} + \varepsilon_t,
$$

where the error term $\varepsilon_t$ is assumed to be white noise with a
constant variance. This constant variance assumption is inadequate for
financial data exhibiting heteroscedasticity.

#### GARCH Model

To address the shortcomings of the constant variance assumption,
Bollerslev (1986) introduced the GARCH model$^8$. The most common
specification is the GARCH(1,1) model, in which the conditional variance
is defined as: $$
\sigma_t^2 = \omega + \alpha\, r_{t-1}^2 + \beta\, \sigma_{t-1}^2,
$$

with:

-   $\omega > 0$ ensuring a baseline variance,

-   $\alpha \geq 0$ capturing the immediate impact of past shocks,

-   $\beta \geq 0$ measuring the persistence of past volatility.

This recursive formulation allows the model to capture volatility
clustering. A large shock (high $r_{t-1}^2$) increases $\sigma_t^2$, and
if $\beta$ is also high, the elevated volatility persists for several
periods.

#### Forecasting and Parameter Estimation

**Forecasting:**\
Assuming that future standardized shocks satisfy $E[z_{t+h}^2] = 1$, the
one-step-ahead forecast for the conditional variance is: $$
\sigma_{t+1}^2 = \omega + \alpha\, r_t^2 + \beta\, \sigma_t^2.
$$

For multi-step forecasting, this formula is iterated recursively.

**Parameter Estimation:**\
The parameters $\omega$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ are typically estimated
via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Under the assumption of
normally distributed innovations, the log-likelihood function for a
sample of size $n$ is given by$^9$ : $$
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{t=1}^{n} \left[ \log(2\pi) + \log(\sigma_t^2) + \frac{r_t^2}{\sigma_t^2} \right].
$$

Maximizing this log-likelihood function with respect to the model
parameters yields the estimates that best explain the observed data.

All in all, while ARMA models are effective for modeling the conditional
mean of a time series, they fall short in capturing the time-varying
nature of volatility observed in financial data. The GARCH model
overcomes this limitation by dynamically modeling the conditional
variance. This explains the volatility clustering phenomenon and
provides a framework for forecasting future volatility.

### Model Fitting

In this section, we provide a detailed introduction to the process of
fitting the ARMA-GARCH model and evaluating it using information
criteria.

We first define a set of candidate ARMA orders (e.g.(2,1)) and GARCH
orders (e.g.(1,1)). For each combination of ARMA and GARCH orders, we
use the `ugarchspec()` function to specify an ARMA-GARCH model$^{10}$ .
This model assumes that the residuals follow a standardized Student-t
distribution. Then use `ugarchfit()` to fit each candidate model onto
the data.

Then, we extract Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information
Criterion from each fitting model and store them in the result table.
These criteria are used to evaluate model fit, where lower values
typically indicate better models. In order to get a more suitable model,
we choose to use log transformation because we have tested it seems a
bad performance with no transformation. Here gives the results:

```{r echo=FALSE}
arma_orders <- list(c(0,1), c(1,0), c(1,1), c(2,1), c(1,2), c(2,2))
garch_orders <- list(c(1,1), c(1,2), c(2,1), c(2,2))
df <- data.frame(Date = data$Date, Volatility =data$SP500.30.Day.Volatility)
df <- log(df$Volatility)

results <- data.frame(
  arma_order = character(),
  garch_order = character(),
  AIC = numeric(),
  BIC = numeric(),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

for (arma in arma_orders) {
  for (garch in garch_orders) {
    spec <- ugarchspec(
      mean.model = list(armaOrder = arma),
      variance.model = list(model = "sGARCH", garchOrder = garch),
      distribution.model = "norm"
    )
    
    fit <- tryCatch(ugarchfit(spec, data = df, solver = "hybrid"), error = function(e) NULL)
    
    if (!is.null(fit)) {
      ic <- infocriteria(fit)
      results <- rbind(results, data.frame(
        arma_order = paste(arma, collapse = ","),
        garch_order = paste(garch, collapse = ","),
        AIC = ic["Akaike",],
        BIC = ic["Bayes",],
        stringsAsFactors = FALSE
      ))
    }
  }
}
print(results)
```

After comparing the candidate models, we proceed to fit a specific
ARMA-GARCH model. In this example, we use an ARMA(2,1) specification
combined with a GARCH(1,1) model, assuming errors with a student-t
distribution. We then fit this model to the log-transformed data.

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
spec_arma_garch <- ugarchspec(
  variance.model = list(model = "sGARCH", garchOrder = c(1, 1)),
  mean.model     = list(armaOrder = c(2, 1)),
  distribution.model = "norm"
)

fit_arma_garch <- ugarchfit(spec = spec_arma_garch, data = df)
```

### Model Diagnostics

To ensure the adequacy of the fitted model, we conduct diagnostic checks
on the residuals. The mathematical derivation of these methods has been
discussed in the previous section.

```{r echo=FALSE}
resid_std <- residuals(fit_arma_garch, standardize = TRUE)
```

-   **QQ Plot of Standardized Residuals**: We plot a QQ plot to assess
    whether the standardized residuals follow the assumed distribution.

```{r echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
qqnorm(resid_std, main = "Normal QQ Plot of (ARMA+GARCH)")
qqline(resid_std, col = "red")
```

The QQ plot shows a heavy tail and significant deviation from the
diagonal reference line, indicating that the residuals may not follow
the assumed normal distribution. There are some limitation within our
model, which will be discussed more in the limitation part.

-   **Residuals analysis**: We plot the autocorrelation function (ACF)
    and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) of the standardized
    residuals to identify any remaining temporal patterns.

```{r echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
acf(resid_std, lag.max = 30, main = "ACF of Std. Residuals")
pacf(resid_std, lag.max = 30, main = "PACF of Std. Residuals")
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

These ACF and PACF plots indicate that the our model effectively
captures the time series structure. That is all peaks are within the
significance range, indicating no substantial autocorrelation. In other
words, standardized residuals behave like white noise, which means that
from a correlation perspective, the model has been adequately defined.

-   **Ljung-Box Test**: We perform the Ljung-Box test on the
    standardized residuals to check for serial correlation.

```{r echo=FALSE}
lb_resid <- Box.test(resid_std, lag = 20, type = "Ljung-Box")
cat("Ljung-Box test on standardized residuals p-value:", lb_resid$p.value, "\n")
```

The Ljung-Box test results show that the standardized residuals and
their squared p-values are both very high (that is far greater than
0.05). This means that there is no statistically significant
autocorrelation in the residuals. So we think the ARMA+GARCH model seems
to fully capture the linear structure and volatility clustering, without
missing any major autocorrelation.

### Model Comparison

We compare the ARMA-GARCH model with the ARMA model by fitting an
ARMA(2,1) model to the same data.

-   **ACF Analysis**:

    -   ARIMA: The ACF of the ARIMA residuals still shows some
        significant lags that exceed the confident bounds. So some of
        the autocorrelation has not been captured. This totally suggests
        that the ARIMA model might miss some dynamic structure in the
        data, like in the volatiltiy clustering.

    -   GARCH+ARMA: The ACF plot is much cleaner, with most lags well
        within the confidence limits. This improved performance is due
        to the ability of component to model conditional
        heteroscedasticity.

-   **QQ Plot Analysis**

    -   ARIMA: The residual plot shows that the ARIMA model's residuals
        deviate significantly from the diagonal line, with heavier
        tails. So it is a poor fit. Many points fall outside the (âˆ’5,5)
        range, shows the presence of significant outliers. This suggests
        that the model fails to adequately capture the distributional
        characteristics of the data, particularly its leptokurtic
        nature.

    -   GARCH+ARMA: The plot demonstrates a better fit, with points more
        closely aligned with the diagonal line and a noticeable
        reduction in extreme deviations. And almost no points fall
        outside the (âˆ’5,5) range. It shows that this model more
        effectively captures the underlying volatility structure and
        reduces the impact of outliers.

-   **Ljung-Box Test**

    -   ARIMA: The low p-value suggests that the ARIMA residuals are
        correlated, so that some serial correlation remains unmodeled.

    -   GARCH+ARMA: With a p-value about 0.522416, the test of this
        model is above the conventinal 0.05 threshold. This shows that
        the residuals are closer to uuncorrelated, meaning the model has
        effectively captured both the autocorrelation and volatility
        effects in this data set.

# Limitation

Here we want to briefly mention our project's limitations and give some
suggestions on future explorations. Both our ARIMA and SARIMA model fail
in the residual checking stage as we find significant correlations and
non-normality; after we take a log transformation and change to
ARMA+Garch model, these phenomenons become less severe but still exist,
especially for the normality assumption, which indicates the necessarity
to build a model based on different error distributions such as
student-t distribution (actually we tried to do so, but we failed in
model explanation and diagnosis) or even more advanced machine learning
algorithms such as LSTM. Another potential issue is within our dataset,
events such as the European debt crisis and the Federal Reserve's policy
shift between 2010 and 2019 could all lead to a sudden surge in
volatility. Also, the recovery phase after the 2008 financial crisis may
have introduced structural or institutional changes that cannot be
captured by the basic GARCH framework. Besides, volatility clusters may
be more extreme or persistent than model assumptions, leading to
underestimation of significant shocks.

# Conclusion

In this study, we analyzed and forecasted S&P 500 30-day realized
volatility using ARIMA, SARIMA, and ARMA-GARCH models, combining
time-domain and frequency-domain techniques. Stationarity testing
confirmed the need for first-order differencing, while spectral analysis
highlighted periodic patterns in volatility. The ARIMA(4,1,3) model
provided a reasonable fit but exhibited residual autocorrelation, and
SARIMA failed to significantly improve performance. The ARMA-GARCH
model, incorporating volatility clustering, offered the best residual
diagnostics, though structural breaks and non-normality remained
challenges. Future work could explore GARCH with heavy-tailed
distributions or deep learning approaches to better capture complex
market dynamics.

# Our Project in Context of Previous Projects

Our project on volatility modelling and trend analysis using ARIMA,
SARIMA, and frequency analysis aligns closely with previous STATS 531
projects in methodology but differs in application, focusing on
financial market volatility rather than public safety, climate, or
cryptocurrency trends. Like past projects, our work relies on
autoregressive models, stationarity tests, AIC-based model selection,
and decomposition techniques such as STL to extract trends, mirroring
the NYC traffic accident analysis for example. Additionally, it shares
similarities with a few previous projects in its use of spectral
analysis, employing Fourier Transform and Power Spectral Density to
uncover periodic volatility patterns. However, our project extends
beyond ARIMA-based modelling by incorporating GARCH models to better
capture volatility dynamics, a methodology that was not a primary focus
in previous projects. Lessons from peer reviews, such as the importance
of clearly defining hypotheses, manually validating model selection,
addressing model limitations, and improving visualization, have guided
our approach to ensure methodological rigor and clarity. Furthermore,
our project connects modelling results to financial risk management,
ensuring statistical insights translate into actionable economic
decisions.
