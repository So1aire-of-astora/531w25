A few days after the midterm projects are submitted, you should expect to receive an email similar to the following. Summary points from past midterm review reports can be found from the [2021](https://ionides.github.io/531w21/midterm_project/), [2022](https://ionides.github.io/531w22/midterm_project/), and [2024](https://ionides.github.io/531w24/midterm_project/) versions of 531. You are welcome to look at these for ideas when writing your reports. Reviews are graded according to a [posted rubric](../rubric_midterm_review.html).

Review assignments for foobar

You have been assigned the following two projects to review. 

* Review 1: Project number baz 
* Review 2: Project number qux 

The projects are listed at https://ionides.github.io/531w25/midterm_project/index.html. Please submit your review reports in a single pdf file on Canvas, by Friday 2/28. The reviews will not be posted publicly, and those who wrote the project should remain blind to your identity. Please do not unblind yourself, and do not question others on which reports they are reviewing. In other words, treat this process with the same respect expected of professional academic peer review. It is not a major problem if you discover who reviews your work, but the review process works well under anonymity. Each report should be about 500 words, and should identify the main strengths and weaknesses of the project (from both technical and conceptual perspectives) as well as identifying points with room for improvement. The Rmd file and other source files are available on the class GitHub repository, and it is appropriate for your report to include comments on coding decisions and reproducibility.
