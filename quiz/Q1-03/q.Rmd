Above are monthly injuries from motor vehicle collisions in New York City. An augmented Dickey-Fuller test, `tseries::adf.test(injuries)`, gives a p-value of 0.01. Which is the best way to proceed:

```{r adf-for-nyc,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,results=FALSE}
my_adf_print <- function(x) cat(
  "data:  ", x$data.name,
  "\nDickey-Fuller = ", x$statistics,
  ", Lag order = ", x$parameter,
  ", p-value = ", x$p.value,
  "\nAlternative hypothesis: ",x$alternative, "\n "
)
my_adf_print(tseries::adf.test(monthly_data$person_injured))
```

A: The time plot indicates a non-constant mean function describing a major dip due to the COVID-19 pandemic and an increasing trend at other times. The ADF test does not support or refute that model.

B: The ADF test indicates that the series is stationary, supporting a decision to fit a SARMA model.

C: The ADF test shows the series is non-stationary, so it should be differenced before fitting a SARMA.

D: The ADF test indicates that the series is non-stationary, supporting the use of a non-constant mean function to describe a major dip due to the COVID-19 pandemic and an increasing trend at other times.
