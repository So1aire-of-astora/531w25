**Solution**. A. The ADF test has a null hypothesis of a unit root linear model and an alternative of a stationary linear model, so neither of these describes a nonlinear trend. Here, the role of the COVID-19 pandemic is large enough that it does not make much sense to build a model that omits it, or describes it as a large perturbation of a stationary process. The conventional interpretation of the ADF test is option C, but differencing the time series does not make COVID-19 go away, making it a poor choice in this situation.
