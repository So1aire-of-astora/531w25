**Solution**. D.\
This is a subtle question, so let's discuss each option. The plotted time series is a realization of a stationary model:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
N <- 1000
sd1 <- rep(1,N)
events <- runif(N) < 5/N
sigma <- 20
amplitude <- 10
sd2 <- sd1 + filter(events,
  dnorm(seq(from=-2.5*sigma,to=2.5*sigma,length=5*sigma),sd=sigma)*sigma*amplitude,
  circular=T)
Y <- rnorm(n=N,mean=0,sd=sd2)
```

Hopefully, this suggests that it should not be clearly non-stationarity, ruling out A. B and E acknowledge the variation in sample variance but do not provide useful ways to assess whther this variable sample variance comes about via a stationary stochastic conditional variance model or via a non-stationary model.

C and D contain a value judgement, "looks appropriate" which is hard to quantify but is (in this case) correct! "Randomly changing variance" is an informal description of a model with stochastic conditional variance. The sample variance estimates the variance conditional on the realization of the conditional variance. The actual variance is an expectation over posible values of the conditional variance. So, between C and D, only D can be correct.
