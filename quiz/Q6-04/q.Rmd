Why is it helpful for a course such as DATASCI/STATS 531, that permits the use of internet resources including GenAI and past solutions, to require students to say explicitly say when they do not use sources?

A. Failure to give credit to sources is against the academic integrity rules of Rackham, the graduate school at University of Michigan.

B. It helps the GSI to grade the homework when they know exactly what sources have been used and for what question.

C. Students whose solution is more dependent on sources than they want to admit are reluctant to explicitly deny using sources.

D. The GSI has the task of evaluating whether the student has demonstrated thought about the homework task beyond collecting material from sources into a solution. This is not an easy task even when the sources are clearly listed and referenced at the point (or points) where they are used.
