1. Multiple choice question title: Interpreting a quantile plot: https://ionides.github.io/531w25/quiz/class09.pdf

Question text:  The question is posted at https://ionides.github.io/531w25/quiz/class09.pdf


Answers: 

A: We should consider fitting a long-tailed error distribution, such as the t distribution.

B: The model is missing seasonality, which could be critical in this situation.

C: For using ARMA methods, these data should be log-transformed to make a linear Gaussian approximation more appropriate.

D: The normal quantile plot shows a long-tailed distribution, but this is not a major problem. We have over 300 data points, so the central limit theorem should hold for parameter estimates.

E: The normal quantile plot shows long tails, but with the right tail noticeably longer than the left tail. We should consider an asymmetric error distribution.

F: We should not interpret (B) before testing for stationarity. First run adf.test() and, if the null hypothesis is not rejected, recalculate (B) when fitting to the differenced data. 


2. essay question title: Supporting reasoning

Give some supporting reasoning for your answer to the multiple choice question. You are expected to write between one and three sentences.

The credit is for Q2 not Q1. For this assignment, the grade is for participation and feedback not correctness.
