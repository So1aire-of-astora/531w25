**Solution**. C.\
Inherited similarities between generations is based on the genotype, which in a POMP model is the Markovian state.
The mutation process that randomly generates the genotype of the child is therefore `rprocess`, the state simulation process.
The expected number of children depends on the fitness, which here is the measurement density.
The actual number of children is a random process, corresponding to the resampling of particles.
