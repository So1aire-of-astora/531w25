**Solution**. C\
  For scientific calculations, you generally have to pick an arbitrary set of units and use it consistently.
  In `pomp`, this means that you have to use the same units for measurement times and within the latent process.
  For example, if your measurement times are in days (7,14,$\dots$) then rate parameters should have units $\mathrm{day}^{-1}$.
  A latent transition with mean duration 1 week would have corresponding rate $1/7 \mathrm{day}^{-1}$.
