The monthly US consumer price index (CPI) combines the price of a basket of products, such as eggs and bread and gasoline. (A) Annualized monthly percent inflation, i.e., the difference of log-CPI multiplied by $12\times 100$ (black line); a smooth estimate via local linear regression (red line). (B) The periodogram of inflation and its smooth estimate. Which best characterizes the behavior of the smoother?

C: Cycles longer than 2 year are removed\
D: Cycles shorter than 2 year are removed\
E: Cycles longer than (1/2) year are removed\
F: Cycles shorter than (1/2) year are removed\
