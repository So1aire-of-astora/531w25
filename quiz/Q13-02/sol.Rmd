**Solution**. E.\
The error message was produced by the code below.
`pomp` passes on the C compiler error message for you to inspect.
Note the missing semicolon in the next-to-last line.

```{r error-code-missing-semicolon,eval=F}
  sir1 <- sir()
  sir2 <- pomp(
    sir1,
    statenames=c("S","I","R","cases","W"),
    paramnames=c(
      "gamma","mu","iota",
      "beta1","beta_sd","pop","rho",
      "S_0","I_0","R_0"
    ),
    rinit=Csnippet("
    double m = pop/(S_0+I_0+R_0);
    S = nearbyint(m*S_0);
    I = nearbyint(m*I_0);
    R = nearbyint(m*R_0);
    cases = 0
    W = 0;"
    )
  )    
```
