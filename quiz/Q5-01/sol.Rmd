**Solution**. A.\
In this example, the units of the "time" variable $n$ are a dimensionless count of firing events.
 So, the units of frequency are cycles per firing event. The units of period are firing events per cycle.
 The peak in the smoothed periodogram corresonds to a cycle length of about $1/0.07\approx 14$ observations. 
 These cycles correspond to oscillations between low firing rate (i.e., long time intervals between firing) and high firing rate (short time intervals between firing).

The units of $y_n$ are time, in milliseconds. It is unusual, and therefore somewhat counter-intuitive, to have a time series with units of time for the measured variable and a dimensionless "time" variable.
