We consider data $y_{1:415}$ where $y_n$ is the time interval, in milliseconds, between the $n$th and $(n+1)$th firing event for a monkey neuron.
Let $z_n = \log(y_n)$, with $\log$ being the natural logarithm.
A smoothed periodogram of $z_{1:415}$ is shown below.
Units of frequency are the default value in R, i.e., cycles per unit observation.
We see a peak at a frequency of approximately 0.07.

```{r,monkey_log_periodogram,echo=FALSE,fig.width=6,fig.height=4}
## THIS WORKS BUT IT'S MESSY. BETTER TO REGENERATE THE PLOT
## image <- png::readPNG(paste0(my_dir,"/monkey-log-periodogram.png"))
## plot(NA, xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 1), type = "n", xaxt = "n",
##   yaxt = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "")
## rasterImage(image,0,0,1,1)
##
## to do this, we could have used
## knitr::include_graphics(paste0(my_dir,"/monkey-log-periodogram.png"))
N2a <- unlist(read.table(file="data/akira2a.asc"))
x<-ts(diff(N2a)[diff(N2a)<10000])/10 # units: milliseconds
z <- log(x)
par(mai=c(1,1,0.1,0.1) )
spectrum(z,spans=c(11,9,13),sub="",main="")
```

Which if the following is the best inference from this figure

A. Transitions between rapid neuron firing (short intervals between firing) and slow neuron firing (long intervals between firing) occur every $1/0.07\approx 14$ firing events.

B. The neuron has a characteristic duration between firing events of $1/0.07 \approx 14$  milliseconds.

C. The neuron has a characteristic duration between firing events of $1/\exp(0.07) \approx 0.9$ milliseconds.
