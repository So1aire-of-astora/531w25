**Solution**. D.\
All the answers are fairly reasonable here! Perhaps the most unreasonable thing would be to be sure there's only one reasonable answer.

However, a more careful optimization using `arima2::arima` shows us that ARMA(2,1) actually has a higher AIC than ARMA(2,2) so all lines of evidence suggest ARMA(2,1) is a better choice. The differences are small, so the choice is unlikely to be highly consequential.

```{r arima2,echo=FALSE}
#dat <- read.table(file="../data/huron_level.csv",sep=",",header=TRUE)
#huron_level <- dat$Jan
set.seed(28)
arma2.2.1 <- arima2::arima(huron_level,order=c(2,0,1),
  max_iters=200,max_repeats=20)
arma2.2.2 <- arima2::arima(huron_level,order=c(2,0,2),
  max_iters=200,max_repeats=20)
arma2.2.1
arma2.2.2
```

Sometimes the multiple starts used by `arima2::arima` make a difference, sometimes the results from `stats::arima` are unchanged. In this case, it happens to make a difference.
