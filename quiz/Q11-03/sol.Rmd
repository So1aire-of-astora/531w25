**Solution**. A.\
  Transferring parameter estimates between scales is hard. An example is the difficulty of reconciling micro and macro economics. It is generally not possible to guarantee that a parameter means exactly the same thing in models at different scales. (A) acknowledges this. The other answers, in various ways, assume that there should be a single parameter value that describes the system at all scales. There is some merit also to (D), since it is reasonable to try to gain biological understanding by investigating why the fitted model is successful at explaining the data. However, this is an observational study and so we should be cautious of making a causal interpretation of models fitted to data due to the possiblity of confounding. Only (A) addresses this concern.
