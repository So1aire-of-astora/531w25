**Solution**. B.\
It would be surprising if substantial sample autocorrelation appeared in the residuals of a GARCH model, at least for a highly traded financial instrument.
This would violate the efficient market hypothesis. 
But that observation is just as true for an i.i.d. white noise model.
The reason to prefer GARCH over an i.i.d. white noise model is to explain the conditional heteroskedasticity, but the ACF does not reveal whether or not that is successful.
