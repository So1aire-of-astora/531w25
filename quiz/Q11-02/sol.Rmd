**Solution**. B.\
All the possibilities are worth consideration. However, adding noise in rates to give flexibility in mean-variance relationships is commonly an important part of developing a stochastic model. The simple compartment model interpretation of a ODE as a Markov chain is determined by the rates and therefore does not have free parameters to describe variance. There is some variance inherent in the Markov chain (demographic stochasticity) but additional variability may be needed. It will be hard to investigate the other possibilities if the model has not been given enough stochasticity to explain the variability in the data, so including overdispersion should be an early step. Note that overdispersion can be included in both the process model and the measurement model.
