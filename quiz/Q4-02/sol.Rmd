**Solution**. C.\
Here's what happens when we take a `log(x+1)` transform, fitting ARMA(2,2) and checking the residuals as before.

```{r log_mers,echo=FALSE,fig.width=7,fig.height=2.5,out.width="5in",}
log_arma22 <- arima(log(mers+1),order=c(2,0,2))
par(mai=c(0.5,1,0.35,0.1))
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(year,log(mers+1), type="l", col="black", ylab="log(MERS Reports+1)", xlab="Year",)
mtext("A",side=3,line=0,at=2012.1,cex=2)
qqnorm(resid(log_arma22))
qqline(resid(log_arma22))
mtext("B",side=3,line=0,at=-4.2,cex=2)
```

It is often a good idea to log-transform non-negative quantities, and failure to do this can show up as long tailed residuals.
Fitting long-tailed ARMA models is possible, but non-standard and not necessary here.
There is seasonality, but an ARMA(2,2) model can already explain some periodicity so including a seasonal term in the model is not critical.
There may be some non-stationarity here, but nothing that resembles the null hypothesis of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, so that is not relevant here.
