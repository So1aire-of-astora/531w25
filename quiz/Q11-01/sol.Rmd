**Solution**. D.\
   Why not A? Likelihoods of different models for the same data can be compared. Likelihood ratio tests using Wilks's theorem specifically require nested models, but in other contexts (such as AIC and the Neyman-Pearson lemma) the models being compared by likelihood do not need to have any particular relationship.

  Why not B? Likelihood ratios have statistical meaning, which corresponds to differences of log likelihoods. The likelihood is a dimensional quantity, whereas the likelihood ratio is dimensionless. The units used correspond to a scientifically arbitrary additive constant to the log likelihood, which disappears after taking differences. 

  Why not C? If our only goal were to find a predictive model, then (C) could be a reasonable position. Usually, we want to find a model that also has interpretable structure, leading to understanding of the system or estimating the effect of interventions. A simple regression model cannot do those things, even if it fits a bit better. If the mechanistic model fits much worse than simple alternatives, it is not providing a reasonable explanation of the data, suggesting that there may be important things missing from the model specification.

  Quite likely, with some persistence, a mechanistic specification will beat a simple off-the-shelf statistical model.
