**Solution**. E.\
```{r logLik-garch-help,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
?tseries::logLik.garch
```
reveals that
```
     ‘logLik’ returns the log-likelihood value of the GARCH(p, q) model
     represented by ‘object’ evaluated at the estimated coefficients.
     It is assumed that first max(p, q) values are fixed.
```
Therefore, the log-likelihood for fiting GARCH(p,q) corresponds only to $y^*_{(\max(p,q)+1):N}$.
The violations of nesting occur because different amounts of data are used for differeng values of $\max(p,q)$.
Therefore, we cannot easily compare likelihoods or AIC values.
