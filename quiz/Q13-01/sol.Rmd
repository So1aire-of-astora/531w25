**Solution**. A.\
  The code producing the error is below.
  Within C snippets, the C versions of R distribution functions are available but they have slightly different syntax from their more familiar R children.
  A complete reference guide to R's C interface is available [as part of R's documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html\#The-R-API).
  In particular, the [C form of R's distribution functions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html\#Distribution-functions) is
  useful for writing C snippets.

```{r error-code-C-vs-R,eval=F}
  sir4 <- simulate(
    sir1,
    statenames=c("S","I","R","cases","W"),
    paramnames=c(
      "gamma","mu","iota",
      "beta1","beta_sd","pop","rho",
      "S_0","I_0","R_0"
    ),
    rmeasure=Csnippet("
      double mean, sd;
      double rep;
      mean = cases*rho;
      sd = sqrt(cases*rho*(1-rho));
      rep = nearbyint(rnorm(1,mean,sd));
      reports = (rep > 0) ? rep : 0;"
    )
  )
```
