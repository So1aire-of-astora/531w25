This question on citing references applies to any statistics report, but it is particularly relevant here since we are learning proper use of sources in order to write open-access midterm and final projects.

Suppose that the midterm project P1 cites a past project, P2, in the reference list. P1 refererences  P2 at one point, mentioning that the projects have similarities. When you look at the source code and the writing, you find various points where P1 and P2 are almost identical, though at other points the projects are entirely different. What do you infer?

A: The authors of P1 have done enough to honestly disclose the relationship with P2. After all, there is sufficient information provided for any reader to track down the exact relationship.

B: The authors of P1 have misrepresented the relationship with P2 by appearing to take credit for some original work which was in fact heavily dependent on a source. This is a serious offence which should be reported to Rackham and/or the Associate Chair for Graduate Programs in Statistics as a violation of academic integrity.

C: There is not enough information to tell the actual story for certain. The authors of P2 may or may not have done something wrong, depending on information that is not available to us, but they did cite P2 so they should be given the benefit of the doubt and should not loose any scholarship points.

D: The authors of P1 have misrepresented the relationship with P2 by appearing to take credit for some original work which was in fact heavily dependent on a source. This is a moderately severe offence, partly offset by including P2 in the reference list. A substantial number of scholarship points should be subtracted.

E: P1 evidently has not shown perfect scholarship, but this is a small issue that could easily be an honest mistake given that the authors were not trying to hide the fact that they had studied P2. It is appropriate to substract, say, 1 point for scholarship for this mistake.
