**Solution**. A.\
For any $AR(p)$ model with $p\ge 1$, an $MA(q)$ representation always has $q=\infty$. One way to see this is to argue by contradiction, by supposing there is a value of $q<\infty$. Then, setting $\phi(x)$ and $\psi(x)$ as the AR and MA polynomials, we can write
$$\frac{1}{\phi(B)} = \psi(B)$$
Thus, $\phi(x)\psi(x)=1$. But $\phi(x)\psi(x)$ has a nonzero $x^{p+q}$ coefficient so it cannot equal $1$.
This argument applies for either real-valued or complex-valued coefficients.
