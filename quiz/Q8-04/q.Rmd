Let $V_n$ be a Markov process and let $W_n=h(V_n)$ for some function $h$.
Which of the following statements are true?

i. $W_n$ is a Markov process for all choices of $h$.

i. $W_n$ is a Markov process for some choices of $h$.

i. $W_n$ is not a Markov process for any choice of $h$.

i. If $V_n=(X_n,Y_n)$ where $X_n$ and $Y_n$ are a POMP, and $h(X_n,Y_n)=X_n$ then $W_n$ is a Markov process.

i. If $V_n=(X_n,Y_n)$ where $X_n$ and $Y_n$ are a POMP, and $h(X_n,Y_n)=Y_n$ then $W_n$ is a Markov process.

A: i,iv,v\
B: ii,iv\
C: ii,v\
D: iii\
E: Some combination other than those listed above
