**Solution**. B\
(iv) is true by definition of a POMP model, and this rules out (iii).
To see that (v) is not generally true, consider a Markov chain, $X_n$ on {1,2,3} which cycles $1\rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 1$, with $X_0$ being uniform on {1,2,3}.
Let $Y_n=A$ if $X_n\in\{1,2\}$ and $Y_n=B$ if $X_n=3$.
Then, $P(Y_{n+1}=B|Y_n=A)=1/2$ which is not equal to $P(Y_{n+1}=B|Y_n=A,Y_{n-1}=A)=1$.
This example also rules out (i).
(ii) is clearly satisfied by the identity function, $h(x)=x$, so we are left with (ii) and (iv).
