1. Multiple choice question title: Comparing ARMA models: https://ionides.github.io/531w25/05/q5-1.html

Question text:  The question is posted at https://ionides.github.io/531w25/05/q5-1.html


Answers: 

A: The ARMA(2,2) model has a lower AIC so it should be preferred.

B:  We cannot reject the null hypothesis of ARMA(2,1) since the ARMA(2,2) model has a likelihood less than 1.92 log units higher than ARMA(2,1). Since there is not sufficient evidence to the contrary, it is better to select the simpler ARMA(2,1) model.

C: Since the comparison of AIC values and the likelihood ratio test come to different conclusions in this case, it is more-or-less equally reasonable to use either model.

D: When the results are borderline, numerical errors in the stats::arima optimization may become relevant. We should check using optimization searches from multiple starting points in parameter space, for example, using arima2::arima.


2. essay question title: Supporting reasoning

Give some supporting reasoning for your answer to the multiple choice question. You are expected to write between one and three sentences.

The credit is for Q2 not Q1. For this assignment, the grade is for participation and feedback not correctness.
