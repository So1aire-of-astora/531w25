**Solution**. B.\
  If the researchers calculate a sliced likelihood through the MLE and tell you it is a profile, but you are concerned they might have constructed a slice by mistake, it is hard to know without looking at the code. (A) is the proper construction of a profile if the points are maximizations over the remaining parameters for a range of fixed values of rho. However, if the code does not involve maximization over other parameters at each value of $\rho$, it cannot be a proper profile. It could be a slice accidentally explained to be a profile, and with a confidence interval constructed as if it were a profile.

If there is only one unknown parameter then a slice and a profile are the same thing, and no maximization is required. This is an unusual situation; there is usually more than one unknown parameter.
