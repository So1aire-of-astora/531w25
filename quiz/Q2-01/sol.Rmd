**Solution**. E.\
This model is not started in its stationary distribution, leading to a covariance that is not shift invariant. The exact calculation is not needed, but it is as follows.
$$\begin{array}{rcl}
\cov(Y_n,Y_k) &=& \cov\left(
  \sum_{i=1}^n \phi^{n-i}\epsilon_i,
  \sum_{j=1}^{n+k} \phi^{n+k-j}\epsilon_j
\right)
\\
&=& \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^{n+k} \phi^{2n+k-(i+j)} \cov(\epsilon_i,\epsilon_j)
\\
&=& \sigma^2 \phi^k \sum_{i=1}^n  \phi^{2(n-i)}
\\
&=& \sigma^2 \phi^k  \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}  \phi^{2i}
\\
&=& \sigma^2 \phi^k(1-\phi^{2n}) \big/ (1-\phi^2)
\end{array}$$
If you didn't see this, you may feel you were tricked. However, it is a common mistake in practical data analysis to pay insufficient attention to initial conditions, so it is worth bringing this to your attention.
