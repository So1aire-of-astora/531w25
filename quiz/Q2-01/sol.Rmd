**Solution**. E. This model is not started in its stationary distribution, leading to a covariance that is not shift invariant. The exact calculation is not needed, but it is as follows.
$$\begin{array}{rcl}
\cov(Y_n,Y_k) &=& \cov\left(
  \sum_{i=1}^n \phi^{n-i}\epsilon_i,
  \sum_{j=1}^{n+k} \phi^{n+k-j}\epsilon_j
\right)
\\
&=& \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^{n+k} \cov(\epsilon_i,\epsilon_j)
\\
&=& \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma^2 \phi^{k+2(n-i)} = \phi^k \frac{\sigma^2(1-\sigma)^{2n}}{1-\sigma^2}
\end{array}$$
If you didn't see this, you may feel you were tricked. However, it is a common mistake in practical data analysis to pay insufficient attention to initial conditions, so it is worth bringing this to your attention.
