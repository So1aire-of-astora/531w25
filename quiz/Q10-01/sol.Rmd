**Solution**. C.\
 A test on simulated data, when the truth is known, can help pin down an optimization problem. All the issues other than C can cause inference problems, but likely would cause similar problems on simulated data.

When there is a reproducible and stable phenomenon of decreasing likelihood, it generally indicates that the unperturbed model is a worse fit to the data than the perturbed model. Recall that the likelihood calculated by iterated filtering at each iteration corresponds to the model with perturbed parameters rather than the actual postulated model with fixed parameters. If the perturbed model has higher likelihood, it may mean that the data are asking to have time-varying parameters. It may also be a signature of any other weakness in the model that can be somewhat accommodated by perturbing the parameters.
