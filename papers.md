## Generic questions

1. What is the weakest part of the paper? i.e., a limitation that may make the paper less useful in practice, or even misleading.

2. What is the strongest part of the paper? i.e., something that the paper demonstrates which deserves to be widely known.

3. Has the paper had an impact on statistical theory and/or methodology and/or applications? Why or why not?

4. Technical questions
    (a) Why was the notation set up this way?
    (b) What steps need additional explanation to be clear to this reader?

5. Study the figures and tables. To what extent do they support the conclusions of the paper?
    
## Meeting format

* Grading is on attendance, participation in a weekly 1-hour discussion, and at least minimal preparation.

* Minimal preparation means spending one hour reading the paper and thinking about its contribution. This is a useful academic skill---we read many more papers superficially than we can read in detail.

* All the papers we read are worth many hours of study, and you are welcome to spend as long as you like if you want to get deeper understanding.
