We continue using material from the short course [Simulation-Based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/) (SBIED). We review likelihood-based inference, and introduce the particle filter (also known as sequential Monte Carlo) which enables likelihood evaluation for general POMP models.
 We use the `pfilter()` implementation of particle filtering in pomp to investigate the likelihood surface for a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model.

Sections I and II review material in Chapter 11, from a slightly different perspective, and you may want to watch this at 1.5 x speed if you are already comfortable with the material.
Section III introduces the particle filter algorithm.
Section IV reviews the likelihood-based inference topics of Chapter 5, in the context of POMP models.
Sections V and VI look at the geometry of the likelihood for an SIR model.
Section VII looks deeper at likelihood inference - there is overlap with Chapter 5 but also some important new ideas.
