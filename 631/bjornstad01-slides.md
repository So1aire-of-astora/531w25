## Impact

* cited 727 times

* Published in _Science_ 


## Concluding challenges

1. both measurement and process stochasticity

2. mechanistic modeling of covariates

3. continuous-time models

4. effective dimension of field data

5. unobserved variables

6. spatiotemporal dynamics

## Context

* 1990s advances in Monte Carlo methods had promise but substantial limitations. They proved insufficient to solve the challenges.

* Deterministic nonlinear dynamics provided candidate mathematical theory for population dynamics, but substantial stochasticity makes that of limited relevance.


## Extra-demographic variation

(p 639, bottom left)

* Log scale variation inconsistent with Poisson and binomial variability

## Wild populations

* Need long-term data, ideally including experimentation

* The (Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Term_Ecological_Research_Network) aims to provide this.

## Since 2001

* What are the main advances (methodological and/or scientific) on this topic over the past 25 years?
